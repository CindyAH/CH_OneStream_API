# CH_OneStream_API
## This API demonstrates calling an API with C# code.  There are three toy APIs included.
- Words allows adding a word to the list and returning a list of words.
- Todos allows adding a todo to the list, returning a list of todos, and returning the total time required to complete all the items in the ToDo list.  The logic is in the business classes, not in the controllers.
- FrontEnd calls the other two APIs.
